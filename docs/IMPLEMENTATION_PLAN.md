# Movify Implementation Plan

> **Goal:** Build a beautiful, expressive Android anime streaming app using Material 3 Expressive design with Vidking as the streaming backend.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### 1.1 Project Setup
- [ ] Initialize Android project with Kotlin & Jetpack Compose
- [ ] Configure Material 3 with `useMaterial3 = true`

  - Ktor/Retrofit (networking)
  - Room (local database)
  - Hilt (dependency injection)
  - Media3 ExoPlayer (optional, for future native playback)

### 1.2 Core Architecture
- [ ] Implement Clean Architecture layers:
  ```
  app/
  ├── data/           # Repositories, data sources, DTOs
  ├── domain/         # Use cases, entities, repository interfaces
  ├── presentation/   # ViewModels, UI state, Composables
  └── di/             # Hilt modules
  ```
- [ ] Set up Navigation Compose with Shared Element Transitions
- [ ] Create base theme with dynamic color extraction

### 1.3 API Integration
- [ ] TMDB API client for anime discovery/search
- [ ] Vidking URL builder utility
- [ ] Watch progress repository (Room + DataStore)

---

## Phase 2: Core Screens (Week 2-3)

**Data Flow:**
```
TMDB API → Repository → ViewModel → LazyVerticalStaggeredGrid
```

### 2.2 Search Screen

**Implementation:**
```kotlin
@Composable
fun VidkingPlayer(
    tmdbId: Int,
    season: Int? = null,
    episode: Int? = null,
    themeColor: String,
    resumeFrom: Int = 0
) {
    val url = buildVidkingUrl(tmdbId, season, episode, themeColor, resumeFrom)
    
    AndroidView(factory = { context ->
        WebView(context).apply {
            settings.javaScriptEnabled = true
            settings.domStorageEnabled = true
            loadUrl(url)
            
            // Add progress listener bridge
            addJavascriptInterface(ProgressBridge(viewModel), "AndroidBridge")
        }
    })
}
```

### 3.2 Player UI Enhancements
**Features:**
- [ ] Atmospheric blur background (poster colors bleeding)
- [ ] Minimalist gesture controls
- [ ] Episode auto-advance (via postMessage)
- [ ] Picture-in-Picture support

**Expressive Elements:**
- [ ] Progressive blur effect around player
- [ ] Haptic feedback on gestures

## Phase 4: Data & Persistence (Week 5)

### 4.1 Local Database (Room)
**Tables:**
- [ ] `WatchHistory` - Track watched content & progress
- [ ] `Favorites` - Saved anime list
- [ ] `SearchHistory` - Recent searches
- [ ] `CachedMetadata` - Offline-accessible anime info

**Schema:**
```kotlin
@Entity
data class WatchHistoryEntity(
    @PrimaryKey val id: String, // "{tmdbId}-{season}-{episode}"
    val tmdbId: Int,
    val type: ContentType,
    val season: Int?,
    val episode: Int?,
    val progressPercent: Int,
    val timestampSeconds: Int,
    val durationSeconds: Int,
    val lastWatched: Long,
    val posterUrl: String,
    val title: String
)
```

### 4.2 Preferences (DataStore)
- [ ] Theme preference (light/dark/system)
- [ ] Autoplay next episode toggle
- [ ] Default video quality
- [ ] Haptic feedback toggle

### 4.3 Offline Support
- [ ] Cache recent posters with Coil disk cache
- [ ] Store last-viewed metadata for offline browsing
- [ ] Graceful degradation when offline
